# Pocket Naturalist

The Pocket Naturalist is a MVP or test run for a long term project that will serve as a way to drive public engagement in conservation and increase visitor count and participation for natural resource and conservation areas. This project will include a set up for a single park including points of interest and mapping to report animal sightings and visualize where animals have been seen in the park. 

In the long term this application will incentivize engagement with points and badges for level of engagement, frequency of visits, or attending presentations. The application will also function as a SAAS program where Park Managers can log on to manage their park and see data on user engagement including user reported trail conditions and where users engage the most within the park.
